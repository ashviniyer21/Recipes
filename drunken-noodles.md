[Original recipe](https://www.joshuaweissman.com/post/the-easiest-stir-fry-dish-drunken-noodles)
<br>
**Time:** 20-30 minutes
<br>
**Servings:** 4

## Ingredients
* 2 Shallots
* 2 Bell Pepper
* 16 Oz (Firm) Tofu
* 4 Thai Chilies
* 20 cloves Garlic
* 2 TBSP Neutral Oil
* 16 Oz Wide Rice Noodles
* 2 Cup Thai Basil
* Stir-fry Sauce
### Sauce
* 2 TBSP Soy Sauce
* 2 TBSP Dark Soy Sauce
* 3 TBSP (Vegetarian) Fish Sauce
* 4 TBSP (Vegetarian) Oyster Sauce

## Instructions
1. Start cooking the noodles to package instructions. This can happen in parallel with the remaining steps.
2. Cut the tofu into cubes. If time permits, press the tofu for 20-30 minutes ahead of time to help remove the water.
3. Fry the tofu in a wok in neutral oil on high heat. This will take some time, periodically stir while cutting other ingredients.
4. Cut the remaining ingredients. Finely dice the garlic, chili, and shallots. Cut the bell pepper into strips.
5. When the tofu is mostly cooked (crispy on some edges), add the garlic, chili, and shallots. Stir fry for 30 seconds - 1 minute.
6. Add the bell pepper to the mixture. Cook for another few minutes
7. Add the noodles to the wok. Mix and let cook for 30 seconds. Mix soy sauce, dark soy sauce, fish sauce, and oyster sauce together in a seperate bowl.
8. Add the sauce mixture to the wok. Mix thoroughly. Be careful not to break the noodle while mixing.
9. Cut the heat on the wok. Cut the basil with a chiffonade and add to the noodles.

## Notes
* Use 1 onion if shallots not available
* Soft / Silken Tofu also works, but requires different preparation. Firm tofu is much easier to work with. Pre-fried tofu can also be added instead.
* It is better to mix the sauces together before adding it the wok. This helps create a more consistent flavor throughout the dish.
