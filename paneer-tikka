## Information
[Original recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiD9ZlG4IC8)
<br>
**Time:** 60 minutes (15 min prep, 45 min wait time)
<br>
**Servings:** 4

## Ingredients
* 1 Red Onion
* 1 Green Bell Pepper
* 16 Oz Paneer
* Ghee
* Marinade
### Marinade
* 2 Cup Curd (Plain Yogurt)
* 4 TSP Kashmiri Chili Powder
* 1 TSP Haldi (Turmeric) Powder
* 2 TSP Dhaniya (Corriander) Powder
* 2 TSP Jeera (Cumin) Powder
* 2 TSP Aamchur (Green Mango) Powder
* 1/2 TSP Black Salt
* 1 TSP Garam Masala
* 2 TBSP Ginger Garlic Paste
* 4 TBSP Besan (Gram Flour)
* 2 TSP Mustard Oil
### Dipping Sauce
* 2 TBSP Green Chutney
* 1/2 Cup Yogurt

## Instructions
1. Make Hung Curd out of the yogurt. This process involves removing the water from the yogurt, which can be a little time consuming. Use a cheese cloth to sqeeuze the water from the yogurt. If you do not have a cheese cloth, look at the notes below.
2. Make the marinade by mixing all the ingredients in together. I reccomend mixing in the chili powder and turmeric first, as it gives the marinade a nicer color.
3. Cut the paneer, onion, and bell pepper into 1" cubes. Add all of them to the marinade, and mix thoroughly to ensure each cube is covered in marinade.
4. Place the mixture in the fridge for at least 30 minutes. This not only lets the marinade flavor the paneer and vegtables, but also helps the filling maintain it's shape when cooked.
5. Heat the air fryer 390F, and place some of the paneer tikka mixture to cook. Do *not* overcrowd the air fryer, its ok to fry in batches. Add some ghee to help the paneer tikka cook.
6. Cook the paneer tikka for at least 5 minutes. If desired, cook for a little bit longer (this will result in a slightly crispy texture).
7. Mix the green chutney and yogurt to make the dipping sauce. If you prefer the sauce more or less strong, add more or less green chutney in the mixture.

## Notes
* 2 TBSP Ginger Garlic Paste can be approximated as 3 garlic cloves and 1 inch ginger
* Use (indian) sesame oil if mustard oil not available. If neither are, use neutral oil.
* Greek yogurt works as a viable substitute. Use 1 cup of greek yogurt instead of 2 cups of normal yogurt, and do not drain the water from it.
* An oven can be used instead of an air fryer. If using this method instead, I suggested broiling the paneer tikka at the end.
