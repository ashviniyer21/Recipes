## Information
Original recipe: Mom
<br>
**Time:** 10 minutes
<br>
**Servings:** 4 cups

## Ingredients
* 1 Cup Basil Leaves
* 2 Cups Spinach Leaves
* 3 Cloves Garlic
* 1/2 Cup Extra Virgin Olive Oil
* 1/4 Cup Pine nuts
* 1/4 Cup Parmesan
* 1 TBSP Lemon Juice
* 1/4 TSP Salt
* 1/4 TSP Black Pepper

## Instructions
1. Lightly toast the pine nuts in a dry pan. Make sure not to fully cook them, just a light toast.
2. Add the basil, spinach, garlic, and pine nuts to a food processor. Start blending.
3. While blending, slowly stream in the olive oil in batches. Check the pesto has the texture you desire. You may need to add less or more oil than listed to achieve your desired texture.
4. Continue blending and grate parmesan into the mixture. This will thicken the pesto a little bit, so add enough oil with this consideration.
5. Add Lemon Juice, Salt, and Pepper. Blend for a little longer to incorporate properly.

## Notes
* Use more basil instead of spinach if desired, spinach helps create more volume for a cheaper price.
*  If you do not have one, use a pestle & mortar. If you have neither, use a blender (although will result in a slightly different texture).
